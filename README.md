# Welcome to the Gardens of Eris

Hi, this is my pet project. I spend very little time on it, and therefore it paces slowly.
This will eventually turn into a discordian game.

One of the main assumptions here, are that the chaos is supposed to create the world. So I went for random gennerated labirynths.

I'm trying to writhe the whole thing with "write everything only once" philosophy in mind.

The file: Diagram1.dia contains more or less the desired classes and their relations, not all of them are pictured here, like the one with video definition class. It is because, there would be too many arrows, and it would make it less readable.
But all children classes from bElem (the ones, that are intended to be drawn in the gamefield) should have the videoDefinition element embeded.
Classes grayed out are not yet even touched. The ones marked with yellow are usable, but incomplete.

Like I said, there is a lot to be done.


Oh, and By the way, I took temporarily the graphics from GNU Robbo.
