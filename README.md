# Welcome to the Gardens of Eris
Hi, this is my pet project. I spend very little time on it, and therefore it paces slowly.
This will eventually turn into a discordian game.
One of the main assumptions here, are that the chaos is supposed to create the world. So I went for random gennerated labirynths.
